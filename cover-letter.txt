x86: Implement an HPET-based hardlockup detector

Hi,

This is the long overdue fifth attempt to implement a hardlockup detector
that uses an HPET channel. Previous versions can be found in [1], [2],
[3], and [4]. I will soon post in the IOMMU mailing list a separate series
to deal with interrupt remapping. Thus, x86 reviewers may hold off on their
review momentarily while the IOMMU experts decide on whether what I propose
makes sense.

This RFC series has been reviewed by Tony Luck <tony.luck@intel.com>

== Introduction ==

In CPU architectures that do not have an NMI watchdog, one can be
constructed using a counter of the Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU).
Counters in the PMU have high granularity and high visibility of the CPU.
These capabilities and their limited number make these counters precious
resources. Unfortunately, the perf-based hardlockup detector permanently
consumes one of these counters per CPU. These counters could be freed
if the hardlockup detector were driven by another timer.

The hardlockup detector runs relatively infrequently and does not require
visibility of the CPU activity (in addition to detect locked-up CPUs). A
timer that is external to the CPU (e.g., in the chipset) can be used to
drive the detector.

A key requirement is that the timer needs to be capable of issuing a
non-maskable interrupt to the CPU. In most cases, this can be achieved
by tweaking the delivery mode of the interrupt. It is especially
straightforward for MSI interrupts.

This implementation uses an HPET timer to deliver an NMI interrupt via
an MSI message.

== Details of this implementation

Unlike the perf-based hardlockup detector, this implementation is
driven by a single timer. Driving the detector with a single timer brings
certain complexities to the implementation: accessing the HPET timer is
slow, and the frequency and the affinity of the timer interrupt needs to be
adjusted periodically. These operations need to happen in addition to
servicing the NMI. In order to address these complexities, this design
meets the following goals:

  * Minimize updates to the affinity of the HPET timer interrupt and do
    it outside of NMI context.

  * Avoid races with System Management Mode that may lead to see the HPET
    count stall or run backwards.

  * Minimize the number of reads and writes to the HPET registers.

Also, as per feedback from Thomas Gleixner,

  * Do not implement an IRQF_NMI to request an NMI interrupt for x86 due
    to the difficulty of identifying its source.

In order to meet the goals above, I implemented what Thomas suggested [5]:
a detector that mixes inter-processor interrupts (IPIs) and updating the
affinity of the HPET interrupt in a round-robin fashion.

The CPUs that the hardlockup detector monitors are partitioned into groups.
A CPU from such group, the handling CPU, handles the NMI interrupt from the
HPET timer and then issues an NMI IPI to the rest of the CPUs in the group.
Each of the CPUs looks for hardlockups upon reception of the NMI. To
minimize IPIs among packages, a group constitutes all the CPUs in a
package.

Since the monitored CPUs now have been partitioned in groups, the HPET
timer needs to target the handling CPU of each group. Hence, the affinity
of the HPET timer is updated in round-robin manner to sequentially target
each group of CPUs. Each group of CPUs will be monitored every 1 second or
less frequently. This is the frequency of the HPET timer interrupt. In the
unlikely case of having more packages than the value watch_thresh, several
packages will be grouped together to keep the HPET timer interrupt at 1
second.

In order to avoid reading HPET registers in every NMI, the time-stamp
counter is used to determine whether the HPET caused the interrupt. At
every timer expiration, we compute the value the time-stamp counter is
expected to have the next time the timer expires. I have found
experimentally that expected TSC value consistently has an error of less
than 1%.

== Parts of this series ==

For clarity, patches are grouped as follows:

 1) HPET updates. Patches 1-3 prepare the HPET code to accommodate the
    new detector: rework periodic programming, reserve and configure a
    timer for the detector and expose a few existing functions.

 3) NMI watchdog. Patches 4-6 updates the existing hardlockup detector
    to uncouple it from perf, and introduces a new NMI handler category
    intended to run after the NMI_LOCAL handlers.

 4) New HPET-based hardlockup detector. Patches 7-11 includes changes to
    probe the hardware resources, configure the interrupt, and rotate the
    destination of the interrupts among all monitored CPUs.

 5) Hardlockup detector management. Patches 12-16 is a collection of
    miscellaneous patches to determine when to use the HPET hardlockup
    detector and stop it if necessary. It also includes an x86-specific
    shim hardlockup detector that selects between the perf- and hpet-based
    implementations. It also switches back to the perf implementation if
    the TSC becomes unstable.

== Testing ==

I tested this series in both client and server systems, single-package and
dual-package systems. I let the system run normally and observed the NMI
interrupts keep coming by inspecting the file /proc/interrupts.

I also implemented a test module to hog a CPU and observed the detector
complain about soft and hardlockups.

Lastly, I wrote a script to keep only one CPU online at a time in a round-
robin manner by doing 500 back-to-back CPU hotplug online/offline 500
times. During the test, I set /proc/sys/kernel/watchdog_thresh to 1 second.
The HPET-based hardlockup detector is still functional after the test. I
used the latest master branch from the tip tree.

The tests above were performed with interrupt remapping both enabled and
disabled.

   inspected for hardlockups using an IPI.
 * Use a round-robin mechanism to update the affinity of the HPET timer.
   Affinity is updated every watchdog_thresh seconds to target the

   management[7].
 * Removed hard-coded channel number for the hardlockup detector.
 * Provided more details on the sequence of HPET channel reservation.
   (Thomas Gleixner)

   kernel command line. The function reserving the channel is called from
   hardlockup detector. (Thomas Gleixner)
 * Dropped hpet_hld_data::enabled_cpus and instead use cpumask_weight().
 * Renamed hpet_hld_data::cpu_monitored_mask to
   hld_data_data.cpu_monitored_mask and converted it to cpumask_var_t.

 * Fixed various typos and grammar errors (Randy Dunlap)

Changes since v2:
 * Added functionality to switch to the perf-based hardlockup
   detector if the TSC becomes unstable (Thomas Gleixner).

   NMI_LOCAL handlers (Andi Kleen).

   arguments.

   (Thomas Gleixner).
 * Added a new intermediate symbol CONFIG_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_CORE to
   select generic parts of the detector (Paul E. McKenney,
   Thomas Gleixner).
 * Removed use of struct cpumask in favor of a variable length array in
   conjunction with kzalloc (Peter Zijlstra).

   (Thomas Gleixner).

   fields (Thomas Gleixner).

   error margin to avoid conditional (Peter Zijlstra).
 * Removed TSC error margin from struct hld_data; use global variable
   instead (Peter Zijlstra).

   reworked hardlockup_detector_hpet_enable()/disable() to not need
   access to watchdog_allowed_mask (Thomas Gleixner).

Changes since v1:

 * Removed reads to HPET registers at every NMI. Instead use the time-stamp
   counter to infer the interrupt source (Thomas Gleixner, Andi Kleen).
 * Do not target CPUs in a round-robin manner. Instead, the HPET timer
   always targets the same CPU; other CPUs are monitored via an
   interprocessor interrupt.
 * Removed use of generic irq code to set interrupt affinity and NMI
   delivery. Instead, configure the interrupt directly in HPET registers
   (Thomas Gleixner).
 * Removed the proposed ops structure for NMI watchdogs. Instead, split
   the existing implementation into a generic library and perf-specific
   infrastructure (Thomas Gleixner, Nicholas Piggin).
 * Added an x86-specific shim hardlockup detector that selects between
   HPET and perf infrastructures as needed (Nicholas Piggin).

   for FSB/MSI delivery (Peter Zijlstra).
